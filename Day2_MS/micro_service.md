# Enhanced AML Microservice Architecture Design

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive microservice architecture for an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) system. The design prioritizes scalability, reliability, and most importantly, security. Given the sensitive nature of financial data and the critical role of AML systems in preventing financial crimes, security is paramount at every level of the architecture.

  - Regularly update and patch the gateway software

### 2.2 User Management Service
- **Function**: Manages user data, profiles, and KYC processes.
- **Features**:
  - User registration with strong password policies
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support
  - KYC document processing and verification
  - Secure profile updates with audit logging
- **Security Measures**:
  - Encrypt all personally identifiable information (PII) at rest and in transit
  - Implement data masking for sensitive fields
  - Use secure randomization for user IDs to prevent enumeration attacks
  - Regular automated scanning for sensitive data exposure

### 2.3 AML Analysis Service
- **Function**: Core engine for AML detection and prevention.
- **Features**:
  - Real-time transaction monitoring and analysis
  - Risk scoring using machine learning models
  - Integration with global watchlists and sanction databases
  - Suspicious activity report (SAR) generation
- **Security Measures**:
  - Implement strict access controls for AML algorithms and models
  - Use homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving computations
  - Employ secure multi-party computation for data analysis across institutions
  - Regular model auditing to prevent bias and ensure regulatory compliance

### 2.4 Notification Service
- **Function**: Manages all system-generated alerts and communications.
- **Features**:
  - Multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, push, in-app)
  - Template-based message generation with personalization
  - Notification scheduling and delivery tracking
  - Support for encrypted communications
- **Security Measures**:
  - End-to-end encryption for all notifications
  - Implement sender policy framework (SPF) and DKIM for email security
  - Use secure protocols (HTTPS, SMTPS) for all communication channels
  - Regular rotation of API keys for external notification services

### 2.5 Authentication and Authorization Service
- **Function**: Manages identity, access control, and session management.
- **Features**:
  - Centralized identity management
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions
  - Single sign-on (SSO) capabilities
  - Secure token management with short lifespans
- **Security Measures**:
  - Use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with appropriate algorithms (e.g., RS256)
  - Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (Authorization Code, Client Credentials)
  - Regular security audits of access patterns
  - Secure storage of credentials using hardware security modules (HSM)

## 3. Data Management and Security

### 3.1 Database per Service Pattern
- Each microservice maintains its own database to ensure data isolation.
- Implement database-level encryption for all data at rest.
- Use database activity monitoring (DAM) tools for real-time threat detection.
- Regular database security assessments and penetration testing.

### 3.2 CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Separate read and write operations for optimized performance and security.
- Implement strict access controls on command (write) operations.
- Use read replicas with data masking for analytical queries.

### 3.3 Data Encryption and Protection
- Employ strong encryption (AES-256) for all data at rest.
- Use TLS 1.3 for all data in transit.
- Implement data loss prevention (DLP) solutions to prevent unauthorized data exfiltration.
- Regular key rotation and secure key management using a dedicated key management service.

## 4. Observability and Monitoring

### 4.1 Centralized Logging System
- Aggregate logs from all services in a central, secure repository.
- Implement log encryption and tamper-evident logging.
- Use SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) for real-time security monitoring.
- Retain logs for the duration required by relevant financial regulations.

### 4.2 Monitoring and Alerting (Prometheus & Grafana)
- Real-time metrics collection with anomaly detection.
- Set up alerts for unusual patterns that may indicate security breaches.
- Monitor system resource usage to detect potential resource exhaustion attacks.
- Implement network traffic analysis for early threat detection.

### 4.3 Distributed Tracing
- Implement using tools like Jaeger or Zipkin.
- Ensure PII is redacted from trace data.
- Use trace data to detect abnormal request patterns or potential attacks.

## 5. Resilience and Security Patterns

### 5.1 Circuit Breaker
- Implement using libraries like Hystrix or Resilience4j.
- Prevent cascading failures and potential DoS scenarios.
- Monitor circuit breaker triggers for potential security incidents.

### 5.2 Saga Pattern
- Manage distributed transactions with a focus on maintaining data integrity.
- Implement compensating transactions with proper access controls.
- Audit all saga orchestrations for compliance and security purposes.

### 5.3 Rate Limiting and Throttling
- Implement at both API Gateway and service levels.
- Use adaptive rate limiting based on user behavior and risk scoring.
- Employ IP-based rate limiting to mitigate brute force attacks.

## 6. Additional Security Measures

### 6.1 Continuous Security Testing
- Implement automated security testing in CI/CD pipelines.
- Regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
- Bug bounty program to encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.

### 6.2 Secure Development Practices
- Enforce code review processes with security-focused guidelines.
- Regular security training for development teams.
- Use of static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST) tools.

### 6.3 Compliance and Audit
- Design the system to meet regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, PSD2, FATF recommendations).
- Implement audit trails for all sensitive operations.
- Regular compliance audits and assessments.

### 6.4 Incident Response Plan
- Develop and regularly test an incident response plan.
- Set up a security operations center (SOC) for 24/7 monitoring.
